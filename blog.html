        <p><a name="Last">Today is going to be my final entry. It seems that no one is looking at my blog and it's getting annoying paying attention to this page or to update it the one time I did, right now. From now on I will be using a different platform for informing the world of my ongoings. Thanks! Have a great day!</a></p>
